-----------------------------------

Author: **Anastasia**

Repo for the submission of the course project for the Johns Hopkins Getting and Cleaning Data course.

**Overview**

This project serves to demonstrate the collection and cleaning of a tidy data set that can be used for subsequent analysis. A full description of the data used in this project can be found at The UCI Machine Learning Repository:

Here are the data for the project:

**Quick Summary of the Project**

You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following. 1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set. 2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set 4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names. 5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

**Steps to work on this course project**

**1.** Download the data source and put into a folder on your local drive. You'll have a UCI HAR Dataset folder. 

**2.** Set  UCI HAR Dataset as your working directory and run "run_analysis.R" code starting from line 35 ( # 1. Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set). 

**3.** The resul is the new file tidyData.txt, which will be save in the directory parent to your initial working directory  UCI HAR Dataset.
